Shiny App Readme
========================================================

Utilize this tool to understand how the expectations of miles per gallon and weight might change based on the number of cylinders. 

1. Select the number of cylinders you would like to view on the left hand side. 
2. View the updated graph on the right hand side. 
3. Also note how the trend line changes based on weight. 

As you will notice, we must view the various trends separately based on cylinder and then put this information together to properly understand the mile per gallon effects based on cylinders and weight.
